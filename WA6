First download the unknown thermophile file from github
  wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/Unk_therm.faa
Assemble this into a blastable database
  makeblastdb -in Unk_therm.faa -dbtype prot -title Unk_therm
Download the sequence of the heatshock protein given for the weekly assigment 
  wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/HSP_prot.fasta
Now you can blast for the HSP in the series of protein file from the unknown thermophile
  blastp -db Unk_therm.faa -query HSP_prot.fasta -out HSP_BLAST.txt -outfmt 7

Questions: 
How many HSPs were found in the unknown organism? 
  6
Provide your justification for how many HSPs were in the organism (use information in the BLAST ouput E-value, length, percent ID, etc).
  5. 
How many HSP have paralogs?
Provide a justification for the presence of paralogs.
