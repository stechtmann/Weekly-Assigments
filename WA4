Also efetch: 
   efetch -db=nucleotide -id=CP000141.1 -format=gb>C.hydrogenogormans.gbk
This will act as the reference genome.
First this genome has to be turned into a fasta file (typo fixed as well). This requires the install of biopython and the genbank_to_fasta.py package
  python genbank_to_fasta.py C.hydrogenogormans.gbk C.hydrogenoformans.fasta

  
Now map the reads to the reference. First build the reference genome 
   bowtie2-build C.hydrogenoformans.fasta C.hydr
Then map the reads
  bowtie2 -x C.hydr -1 C_Ferri_R1.fastq -2 C_Ferri_R2.fastq -S Z2901.sam
  
Quality assesment 
  fastqc C_Ferri_R1.fastq.gz
  fastqc C_Ferri_R2.fastq.gz
 Then remove any present adaptors 
  cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_Ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p C_Ferri_R2.fastq C_Ferri_R1.fastq C_Ferri_R2.fastq
# not working as error due to different number of reads is thrown
   tried: cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_Ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq C_Ferri_R1.fastq
# here it came out that somwe how the R2 fastq file was empty
   tried: cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_Ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq C_Ferri_R2.fastq


Answers to questions: 
Use Fastq to assess the quality of each of these files.
   Were these reads of high quality? R1 - yes. The per base sequence quality is very good, as well as the Phred scores overall (with the mean around 37)
                                     R2 - yes this one is high queality too. It has a little more spread in it's phred scores, but on average it is still very high
   Was trimming required? For R1 and R2 adapter trimming could be tried to further purify the data, as there are a significant amount of overrepreented sequences that could be sigle end primers.
     Use cutadapt to remove adaptors
   How many reads contained adaptors for each file?  R1 -> 18,001 
                                                     R2 -> 14,855 
Use bowtie2 to map the C. ferrireducens read to the reference.
   What percentage of the reads mapped to the reference genome? 0
   What percentage of reads did not map to the reference genome?  100
