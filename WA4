Also efetch: 
   efetch -db=nucleotide -id=CP000141.1 -format=gb>C.hydrogenogormans.gbk
This will act as the reference genome.
First this genome has to be turned into a fasta file (typo fixed as well)
  python genbank_to_fasta.py C.hydrogenogormans.gbk C.hydrogenoformans.fasta
#Then the downloaded genomes need to be unzipped and turned into fastq files
  
Now map the reads to the reference. First build the reference genome 
   bowtie2-build C.hydrogenoformans.fasta C.hydro
Then map the reads
  bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C_Ferri_R1.fastq.gz -2 C_Ferri_R2.fastq.gz -S Z2901.sam
  
Quality assesment 
  fastqc C_Ferri_R1.fastq.gz
  fastqc C_Ferri_R2.fastq.gz
 Then remove any present adaptors 
  cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o T1_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p T1_R2.cutadapt.fastq C_Ferri_R1.fastq.gz C_Ferri_R2.fastq.gz
