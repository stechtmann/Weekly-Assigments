Also efetch: 
   efetch -db=nucleotide -id=CP000141.1 -format=fasta>C.hydrogenoformans.T2.fasta
##This will act as the reference genome. In fasta format


  
Now map the reads to the reference. First build the reference genome 
    bowtie2-build C.hydrogenformans.T2.fasta C.hydrT2
Then map the reads
   bowtie2 -x C.hydrT2 -1 C_Ferri_R1.fastq -2 C_Ferri_R2.fastq -S Z2901T2.sam
  
  
Quality assesment 
  fastqc C_Ferri_R1.fastq.gz
  fastqc C_Ferri_R2.fastq.gz
 Then remove any present adaptors 
  With given sequence in class: cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_Ferri_R1T2.cutadapt.fastq -p C_Ferri_R2T2.fastq C_Ferri_R1.fastq C_Ferri_R2.fastq
  With sequences identified by the fastqc, using the two most abundant:  cutadapt -q 20,20 -a GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATATCGTATGCCGT -A GATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCG -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_Ferri_R1T2.cutadapt.fastq -p C_Ferri_R2T2.fastq C_Ferri_R1.fastq C_Ferri_R2.fastq
Quality assesment was ran again
   fastqc C_Ferri_R1T2.cutadapt.fastq
   fastqc C_Ferri_R2T2.cutadapt.fastq
After this the adaptcut files were remapped using bowtie 2
   bowtie2 -x C.hydrT2 -1 C_Ferri_R1T2.cutadapt.fastq -2 C_Ferri_R2T2.cutadapt.fastq -S Z2901T2.cut.sam   


Answers to questions: 
Use Fastq to assess the quality of each of these files.
   Were these reads of high quality? R1 - yes. The per base sequence quality is very good, as well as the Phred scores overall (with the mean around 37). However there are some issues with overrepresented sequences
                                     R2 - yes this one is high queality too. It has a little more spread in it's phred scores, but on average it is still very high. Here there are also some issues with overrepresented sequences.
   Was trimming required? For R1 and R2 adapter trimming could be tried to further purify the data, as there are a significant amount of overrepreented sequences that could be sigle end primers.
                          After trimming the adaptors, the fastqc file no longer showed issues with the overrepresented sequenes, however, the program does suggest further analysis for sequence lenght distributions for both files.
Use cutadapt to remove adaptors
   How many reads contained adaptors for each file?  Using orignal sequence: R1 -> 18,001    R2 -> 14,855 
                                                     Using sequences identified through fastcq R1 -> 62,221    R2 -> 48,486 
Use bowtie2 to map the C. ferrireducens read to the reference.
   What percentage of the reads mapped to the reference genome? The average alignment rate before the cutadapt was 74.52%. After the adaptor trimming the average alignment rate went up to 78.66%
