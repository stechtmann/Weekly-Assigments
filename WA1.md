sort WA1.fasta| head -3 > types_of_alpha_globin.txt | ls

When you import the data found in WA1.fasta the sort comman should aphabetize the data and put the entries containing  >alpha in the first few lines.
Knowing there are three types of alpha in the document we could then print the first three lines to a text document. 
ls will then show you all the files in your current directory which should include the types_of_alpha_globin.txt file
